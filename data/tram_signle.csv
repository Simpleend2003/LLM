Another difference in the network traffic generated from the malware is that the encoded proxy information has been added in the URL query values during the C2 communication,['T1132']

This command is particularly interesting as it enables an alternative command and control channel that uses the Google Drive API,['T1102']
"To use Google Drive, the x_mode command received from the C2 server via DNS tunneling will be followed by a newline-delimited list of settings needed to interact with the Google Drive account",['T1102']

The CAB file contains the following files and functions:  dll: A malicious DLL used to launch batch files (used with cliconfg.exe for UAC bypass),['T1548.002']
"The macro then extracts the CAB file into %systemroo%\system32, using either wusa.exe or expand.exe (depending on the OS) to again bypass UAC prompts Once the files have been extracted, the Visual Basic macro deletes the CAB file and runs the malicious NTWDBLIB.dll via cliconfg.exe (to gain privileges and bypass UAC protections) Command lines used by the Visual Basic macro:  cmd /c wusa %TEMP%\setup.cab /quiet /extract:%SystemRoot%\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe cmd /c expand %TEMP%\setup.cab -F:* %SystemRoot%\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe A combination of NTWDBLIB.dll and cliconfg.exe are used to bypass UAC protections; this is a familiar attack on Windows",['T1548.002']
The key differences in this variant:  Two CAB files are encoded into the Word document in text boxes instead of being appended in the DOC file There is one CAB file for an x86 system and another for an x64 system This malware sample uses uacme.exe with dummy.dll to implement the UAC bypass  exe is the program vulnerable to the UAC bypass attack dll runs install.bat to set up the service (same as NTWDBLIB.dll)   exe and dummy.dll may be either 64-bit or 32-bit binaries based on the OS,['T1548.002']
BUGJUICE is a backdoor that is executed by launching a benign file and then hijacking the search order to load a malicious dll into it,['T1574.001']
This most likely means there is some type of DLL hijacking going on by distributing a legitimate McAfee binary with MirageFox to load up the DLL properly into a legitimate looking process,['T1574.001']
Whitefly has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run Vcrodat.,['T1574.001']
Attackers can therefore give a malicious DLL the same name as a legitimate DLL but place it ahead of the legitimate version in the search order so that it will be loaded when Windows searches for it.,['T1574.001']
"Nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking, and downloads an encrypted payload to the infected computer.",['T1574.001']
Persistence is maintained through a Run registry key,['T1547.001']
"This marker indicates the presence of an encrypted MZ marker in the .hwp file and is decrypted by the malware and written to the Startup folder for the user:  C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\viso.exe  This step establishes the persistence of the malware across reboots on the endpoint Once the decrypted MZ marker is written to the Startup folder, the 2.hwp is deleted from the endpoint  The malware might perform this activity for a couple of reasons:  Establish persistence for itself on the endpoint Establish persistence of another component of the malware on the endpoint Update itself on endpoint after a separate updater component downloads the update from the control server  The malware has limited reconnaissance and data-gathering capabilities and is not full-fledged spyware",['T1547.001']

The .zip archive attached to the email contains a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file with the Microsoft Internet Explorer logo,['T1547.009']
Clicking on the shortcut ultimately leads to Backdoor.Pirpi being downloaded and executed on the affected computer,['T1547.009']
Comnie is able to achieve persistence via a .lnk file that is stored within the victim’s startup path,['T1547.009']
"Additionally, in the event Kaspersky is detected, the malware will immediately run the ‘Conime.lnk’ shortcut file in a new process after it is created",['T1547.009']
This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim,['T1547.009']
"In this ongoing campaign, FIN7 is targeting organizations with spear phishing emails containing either a malicious DOCX or RTF file – two versions of the same LNK file and VBScript technique",['T1547.009']

"Figure 3: FIN7 phishing lure persistence mechanisms Examining Attacker Shortcut Files In many cases, attacker-created LNK files can reveal valuable information about the attacker’s development environment",['T1547.009']

"LNK files have been valuable during Mandiant incident response investigations as they include volume serial number, NetBIOS name, and MAC address",['T1547.009']
The LNK file is finally used to identify a third file: a ZIP file,['T1547.009']

This shortcut file calls the built-in ‘control.exe’ utility to in turn load the previously dropped malicious CPL file of ‘winhelp.cpl’,['T1547.009']
The lnk files were an especially interesting development because the powershell code they contain for decoding and dropping the payload is nearly identical to that utilized by the Zebrocy threat actor a month earlier,['T1547.009']

The attackers used spear phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul Office Suite,['T1598.002']
"We suspect the attacker was trying to generate sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in, Kangwon, were part of a unified province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to the division of Korea in 1945.A second email contained a story about a person called 'Ewing Kim' who was looking for help:The email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same vulnerability (CVE-2013-0808)",['T1598.002']
This campaign began with a handful of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious attachments,['T1598.002']

This attack diverged from previous attacks we observed from this group as it involved spear-phishing emails sent to targeted organizations with password protected RAR archive attachments that contained malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy),['T1598.002']
In this instance a spear phishing email was used containing a lure designed to socially engineer and entice the victim to executing a malicious attachment,['T1598.002']
"In contrast to the two samples used in these attacks, this one did not use a PE attachment, and instead used a Microsoft Word document containing a malicious macro as the delivery vehicle",['T1598.002']
